FarmFair Development Constraints

    Local AI Model: Uses DeepSeek-R1:7b via Ollama, requiring significant RAM (~16 GB) or GPU.

    Web-Based: Mobile-optimized web app, not a native mobile app, to simplify development.

    Mock Data: News and price updates are static due to demo constraints; real APIs require additional setup.

    No Real Logistics: Transportation feature is mocked (estimated delivery times) to avoid complex integrations.

    SQLite: Lightweight database suitable for demo but may not scale for production.

    Security: Basic authentication (username/password) without advanced measures (e.g., OAuth, encryption).

    Demo Focus: Prioritizes functionality for presentation over production-grade features (e.g., payment gateways).
